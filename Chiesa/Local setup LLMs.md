# Local setup LLMs
## Domanda:

I wish to initialize my notebook to support two local LLMs (running NOT at the same time).
First'll do:
- Work only in local, w/out Internet access, throught my .md files (write for Obsidian.MD platform), about 1K files, in Italian language, then suggest me internal link and indexing datas;
- Trasform scanned text (Jpg, Pic, Jpeg, Png, Pdf and ePub) into text MD files. Scanned texts are writen in Italian, Latin and Ancient Greek;
Second'll do:
- Work locally (but also online if necessary) to help me in JavaScript, CSS, Powershell and Python programming with Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
Here is my configuration:

PC:
- Acer Predator PH317-56

CPU:
- 12th Gen Intel i7-12700H

RAM:
- 2x16Gb Samsung DDR5 x4800 (@2400MHz) + 2 slot free

Graph:
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU 8Gb GDDR6

2x SSD:
- Crucial P3 4TB M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 NVMe (Os + Progr)
- WD Black WDS800T2XHE 8 TB M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 NVMe (Doc)

Os:
- Win 11 Pro updated

What you can suggest me?


Your setup is solid, and you have a pretty clear plan for the tasks you want to tackle. Let me break down some suggestions and tools you can use to meet your needs for both tasks. Since yoÙre working locally (and sometimes online), I'll focus on efficient and flexible solutions that respect your offline-first approach. Also, I'll suggest options for your development environment to maximize productivity.

## Risposta CHATGPT on 13/07/2025:

### **1st Task: Work with Obsidian.md (Offline, Italian Language, Local LLMs)**

#### **LLM Selection and Setup (Offline)**

Since you want to use local LLMs, there are a few options you can explore for running models directly on your system:

- **GPT-NeoX**: Open-source models like GPT-NeoX can be a good option for local use. You can run it on your machine, especially with the power of your CPU and GPU. These models are available through the Hugging Face model hub.
    
    - **Setup**: You could run the model in Python with `transformers` and `torch` libraries. You’ll need to install the required dependencies like `cuda` (for GPU support) or use the CPU for more manageable resource consumption.
        
    - **Alternative**: **Llama 2** models, which are optimized for local setups, are also an option.
        
- **Language Models Specific for Italian**: Look for models pre-trained for Italian (for example, `BERTino` or other Italian-focused LLMs). You may need to fine-tune these models for optimal performance based on your corpus of 1k Italian files.
    

#### **Local Link and Indexing for Obsidian.md**

Obsidian is a great choice for knowledge management, and there are some tools and plugins you can integrate to optimize the indexing:

- **Obsidian Plugin: "Link Suggestion"**: This plugin can automatically suggest relevant internal links while yoÙre writing. It might help you organize your 1k Italian files into relevant clusters. You can even use custom query blocks in Obsidian to list notes on specific topics, making it easier to navigate.
    
- **Zettelkasten**: If you’re into linking ideas between notes (Zettelkasten method), you can use plugins like **Zettelkasten Prefixer** or just rely on your own approach to tagging and linking related notes.
    
- **Indexing**: For indexing, Obsidian already has a good built-in search, but you can also consider third-party indexing tools for markdown files, such as **Llamacache** (for faster search) or **Obsidian Dataview** to create more complex dynamic views of your files.
    
- **Obsidian.md Workflow**:
    
    - Make sure you structure your files into logical folders (perhaps by topic, date, or language).
        
    - Use tags for easy retrieval, like `#italian`, `#latin`, `#greek`.
        
    - Automate internal linking using the `Auto Link Titles` plugin or with scripts you create to match specific keywords between notes.
        

#### **Text Transformation (OCR) for Scanned Documents**

For OCR and text extraction, yoÙll need tools that can handle multiple formats (JPG, PNG, PDF, ePub) and multiple languages, including Latin and Ancient Greek. Here are some tools you can set up locally:

- **Tesseract OCR**: This is a powerful open-source OCR tool that can recognize Italian, Latin, and Ancient Greek with proper language models. It's best used in combination with Python scripts to automate the process.
    
    - Install with `pip install pytesseract` and configure the Tesseract OCR engine to recognize the necessary languages.
        
    - Tesseract works well for scanned PDFs, images, and even ePub files (if you extract the content from the ePub first).
        
- **Calibre**: Calibre can convert ePub files to Markdown, and you can combine this with OCR to handle mixed-content formats.
    
- **Language-specific OCR models**: For Latin and Ancient Greek, you may need to train or fine-tune the OCR engine with relevant text samples.
    

You can automate the whole pipeline with Python to:

1. Convert scanned PDFs or images to text.
    
2. Format the text into Markdown.
    
3. Store each page/section as individual MD files, ready to be imported into Obsidian.
    

### **2nd Task: JavaScript, CSS, PowerShell, and Python Programming Assistance**

For programming support, you can use your local LLM or various plugins and extensions to enhance your IDE (VS Code) experience:

#### **Local LLM Support for Code Assistance**

- **Local LLMs for Code Assistance**: If you want a local LLM for coding help, **Code Llama** (a variant of Llama 2 fine-tuned for code) could be a great option to deploy. Running it locally will let you ask coding questions, generate code, and receive explanations without needing internet access.
    
    - You could use `transformers` and `torch` in VS Code’s terminal for local execution.
        
    - **Auto-completion and error detection**: The LLM could help auto-generate code snippets, troubleshoot syntax errors, or suggest optimizations.
        

#### **VS Code Extensions for Productivity**

For each programming language you want assistance with, here are some extensions:

1. **JavaScript**:
    
    - **Prettier**: Auto-formatting for JavaScript.
        
    - **ESLint**: Linting for JavaScript to catch errors early.
        
    - **JavaScript (ES6) code snippets**: Helpful snippets for faster coding.
        
2. **CSS**:
    
    - **CSS Peek**: Allows you to peek into CSS definitions.
        
    - **CSS Grid**: Helps with grid layout generation.
        
    - **PostCSS**: Advanced post-processing of CSS.
        
3. **PowerShell**:
    
    - **PowerShell Extension**: Integrated PowerShell scripting support in VS Code with IntelliSense, debugging, and more.
        
    - **PowerShell Preview**: For working with the latest PowerShell features.
        
4. **Python**:
    
    - **Python Extension for VS Code**: Essential for linting, debugging, and environment management.
        
    - **Pylance**: Language server for faster Python completions.
        
    - **Jupyter**: If you do data science or machine learning, this extension allows you to work with Jupyter Notebooks inside VS Code.
        

#### **Virtual Environments for Each Language**

You could set up isolated environments for each language:

- **JavaScript**: Use `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management.
    
- **Python**: Use `venv` or `conda` to isolate dependencies.
    
- **PowerShell**: Ensure your scripts are running with the appropriate versions of PowerShell (use `PSVersionTable` to check versions).
    

### **Hardware & Performance Optimization**

Given your powerful hardware setup (especially your GPU), yoÙll be able to handle LLMs like Code Llama or GPT-NeoX quite efficiently. Here's how to optimize:

- **GPU Utilization**: Make sure you have CUDA installed for PyTorch and TensorFlow (if using these libraries for LLMs).
    
- **SSD Storage**: Use your 4TB SSD for system/working files and the 8TB SSD for archiving your scanned documents, models, and datasets.
    
- **RAM**: You should have no issues running local LLMs with your 32GB RAM, but it’s good practice to monitor your system’s resource usage when running large models or processing multiple documents.

### **Final Thoughts**

You have a good mix of hardware and software to tackle your goals, both for managing your Obsidian.md vault and for coding support. Focus on:

- Choosing and setting up the right local LLMs.
    
- Automating your OCR and text processing pipeline for scanned documents.
    
- Optimizing your IDE with VS Code extensions for efficient coding in your languages of choice.
